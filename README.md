# Hello there, I'm Ben! üëã

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm passionate about **coding**, **teaching**, and **continuously learning** every aspect of software development.

With a background in hospitality management, I made a significant career pivot into tech. Fueled by my broad curiosity about technology, I quickly realized how much I enjoyed the challenges and rewards of the development work.
